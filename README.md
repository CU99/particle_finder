# particle_finder
Classifying atoms from Argon and Germanium Telluride configurations through python and machine learning techniques.

Ten Wolde
----------

Contains the python scripts for implementation of the Ten Wolde method.


Descriptors (Argon)
-----------

Contains the python scripts used to calculate descriptors from argon files and pickle them into a text file.


Descriptors (GeTe)
------------------

Contains the python scripts used to calculate descriptors from GeTe files and pickle them into a text file.


Processors
----------

Contains the python scripts used to process the text files, process the descriptors for training and testing the neural network, and save them as an npy file.


Argon Classifiers
------------------------

Contains the neural networks used to classify argon atoms from solid fcc, liquid and amorphous structures.


GeTe Classifiers
----------------

Contains the neural networks used to classify atoms from alpha, beta and quenched GeTe structures.


Make Plots
----------

Contains codes to produce some of the plots used within the investigation.
